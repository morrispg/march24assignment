# march24assignment aka #Semantic HTML Homework assignment aka morrispg/march24assignment

The goal of this assignment was to improve the accessability of the code to make it a better site for assissted readers, as well as reduce redundancies and apply better formatting.

I was really excited to replace 'div' tags in this project and articulate the format with semantic tags.

At first I was confused where to use '<alt>' tags, but with some help I think I got them properly placed. This project also helped me apply CSS skills and learn about reducing redundant code.

Below is a link to the project:

Thank you.
